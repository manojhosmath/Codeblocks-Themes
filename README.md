# Codeblocks-Themes

This repo has codeblocks editor themes. I do not own these themes or the files. I created this repo as a backup if in case the website I got it from vanishes in the future. The website I got these files from : https://sangams.com.np/installing-codeblocks-dark-themes/

To install on different OS, follow instructions on the site mentioned above or watch this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7uVSrnrnU

On ubuntu, I did these things to install:

1. Exit CodeBlocks if already opened.
2. Open terminal and type, cb_share_config
3. Browser Destination Configuration file which is in right side.
4. Select default.conf
5. Browse Source Configuration file which is in left side.
6. Select the downloaded theme.conf
7. Tick all the checkbox that appeared in source configuration file.
8. Click on Transfer and then Save, and then Close.
